<p align="center"><b>Save and load quicksaves in your Balatro runs as you would in Skyrim.</b></p>

## Usage

- The mod requires [SMODS](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)
- Drop this entire folder into your [Mods](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki#method-3a-direct-download) directory.
- You can use the provided buttons or with the `f5` and `f9` keys to save and load respectively.
- This mod can perform hotloads so you wont need to go back to the main menu to load a save.

## Additional Info

The [Balatro Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer) is set as a conflict because it would be against the spirit of fair competition and I doubt it would play nice with this mod anyway.

I also recommend [Divvy's History](https://github.com/DivvyCr/Balatro-History) for a slightly less convenient but much more comprehensive save managing mod, as far as I have tested this mod does not conflict with theirs so you can have your cake and eat it too.
